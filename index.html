    <div class="description-right"><i>Naruto Uzumaki is a young boy from the Hidden Leaf Village and the biggest problem
        child at the ninja academy.
        He causes mischief every day and is constantly being scolded by his teacher, Iruka Umino. He has fallen so far
        behind in his studies that his graduation is uncertain, but Naruto actually dreams of becoming the leader of the
        village, known as the Hokage, and vows to one day become the No. 1 ninja.
        However, all the adults in the village treat Naruto with disdain due to a secret surrounding his birth. 12 years
        ago, when Naruto was just a baby, the Nine-Tailed Fox attacked the village, and the only way to stop it was to
        seal it inside of him. Naruto manages to defeat Mizuki with Iruka’s help, who despite knowing about Naruto’s
        past, has always believed in him. After learning Iruka’s true feelings, Naruto gains a renewed determination to
        pursue his dream.</i></div>

    <div class="description-left"><i>Sasuke Uchiha (うちはサスケ，Uchiha Sasuke) is one of the last surviving members of
        Konohagakure's
        Uchiha clan. After
        his older brother, Itachi, slaughtered their clan, Sasuke made it his mission in life to avenge them by killing
        Itachi. He is added to Team 7 upon becoming a ninja and, through competition with his rival and best friend,
        Naruto Uzumaki, Sasuke starts developing his skills, but eventually grows dissatisfied with his progress. He
        defects from Konoha so that he can acquire the strength needed to exact his revenge and master the Cursed Seal
        of Heaven. His years of seeking vengeance and his actions that followed become increasingly demanding,
        irrational and isolates him from others, leading him to be branded as an international criminal. After learning
        the truth of his brother's sacrifice, later proving instrumental in ending the Fourth Shinobi World War, and
        being happily redeemed by Naruto, Sasuke decides to return to Konoha and dedicate his life to help protect the
        village and its inhabitants, becoming referred to as the "Supporting Kage" (支う影，Sasaukage, literally meaning:
        Supporting Shadow).
